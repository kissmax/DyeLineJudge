# DyeLineJudge
This runs on a raspberry pi attached to the center of a table to detect the centerline used in beer dye. The robot monitors the centerline to detect when a playing die makes contact with the table in its vision. The trajectory of the die and its impact location are tracked by a camera. The impact location is displayed to the players via LED array to idicate whether or not the toss was legal.
